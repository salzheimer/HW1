			Hello my name is Scott Alzheimer, I am currently a Senior at the University of Iowa. 
			I am double majoring in Management Information Systems and Entrepreneurial Management along with a minor in Computer Science.
			My professional life has taken my changes the last 15 years, but one thing holds true I enjoy the opportunity to learn new things and sharing that knowledge with others.
			The jobs I have had follow my passions and have built on each other as I switch paths. From working for the local television news station (while in college dreaming of being an independent film maker)
			to running a recording studio in Chicago. The latest reinvention will bring all my experiences together into one amazing future.    
			</p>
			<p>
				I am a man of many interests technology, the arts, cooking and food, and nature. I believe my passion for the arts and technology have shaped my professional path.
				Of the arts I favor music, I have not learn to play <u>yet</u>, but I have done many recordings for other musicians.
