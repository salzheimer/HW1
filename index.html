					Hello my name is Scott Alzheimer, I am currently a Senior at the University of Iowa. 
					I am double majoring in Management Information Systems and 
					Entrepreneurial Management along with a minor in Computer Science.
					My professional life has taken my changes the last 15 years, 
					but one thing holds true I enjoy the opportunity to learn new things and sharing that knowledge with others.
				</p>
				<p class="p1">
					The jobs I have had follow my passions and have built on each other as I switch paths.
					 From working for the local television news station (while in college dreaming of being an independent film maker)
					to running a recording studio in Chicago. The latest reinvention will bring all my experiences together into one amazing future.
